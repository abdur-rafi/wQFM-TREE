## File Descriptions
Here we provide descriptions of some of the scripts that would be useful in running the experiments again. 
1. [runAstral2DatasetsEstPaup.sh](./runAstral2DatasetsEstPaup.sh) is used to run a method on all the replicates of a certain model condition and generate the rf scores of all the replicates.  
2. [treeCleaner.py](./treeCleaner.py) removes branch scores from a tree.
3. [run_paup_consensus.pl](./run_paup_consensus.pl) is used to generate a consensus file using the paup package. 
4. [pvalue.py](./pvalue.py) is used to generate p values using scipy.stats package.
